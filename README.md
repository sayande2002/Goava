## Prerequisites 📋

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
```

From your command line, first clone this repo:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/sayande2002/Goava-frontend.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd Goava-frontend

# Remove current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
```

Then you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn:

Using NPM:

```bash

$ npm install

# Start development server
$ npm start
```

Once your server has started, go to this url `http://localhost:3000/` and you will see the website running on a Development Server.
